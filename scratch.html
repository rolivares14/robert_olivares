<center><h3><strong>My parnter and I used the programming language Scratch
to program our project. The project is an arcade style game and you use the 
arrow <br>keys to move side to side. The purpose of the game is to kill as many
ogres as possible with Donald Trump's taco shooting super power.<br> After you 
get a certain amount of points you are transported to a different area and 
the final boss appears. When the boss appears the moving <br>style changes
and Trump is now able to move in an infinity symbol using all of the arrow 
keys. My partner and I ran into a few problems when <br>it came to coding. We 
struggled while coding the taco sprite and were not able to get the tacos 
to shoot at first. Fortunely we were able to overcome <br>every problem
that came our way and made a fun and enjoyable game. I learned about 
abstractions and the importance of using them due to their <br>ability of 
allowing the coder to hide all of the irrelevant data. Abstractions help 
reduce complexity and increase efficiency.</strong></h3></center>
