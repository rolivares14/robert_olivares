<pre style="color:white;">My reflection. My parnter and I used the prgramming language Scratch
to program our project.The project is an arcade style game and you use the arrow keys to move 
side to side. The purpose of the game is to kill as many ogres as possible with Donald Trump's 
taco shooting super power. After you get a certain amount of points you are transported to a different
area and the final boss appears. When the boss appears the moving style changes
and Trump is now able to move in an infinity symbol using all of the arrow keys. My partner and 
I ran into a few problems when it came to coding. We struggled while coding the taco sprite and
were not able to get the tacos to shoot at first. Fortunely we were able to overcome every problem
that came our way and made a fun and enjoyable game. I learned a lot from this experience
and enjoyed every step of the way.</pre>
