<h1 style="color:white;">Reflection On the Project</h1>
<p style="color:white;">This project was tedious and time consuming. It was similar to the Repl.it project in regards 
to having to code in Python but the coding was more advance. My partner and I spent one week creating code in order 
to manipulate an image. These manipulations include adding a blue border around the frame of the image and rounding 
off the edges. Line 5 of the coding creates the border around the imag while lines 39-46 rounds the edges. Line 56 
saves the newly modified images and gives it the name that the user input when the code was ran.</p>
