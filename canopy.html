<center><h1 style="color:white;">Reflection On the Project</h1></center>
<center><h3 style="color:black;">This project was tedious and time consuming. It was similar to the Repl.it project in regards 
to having to code in Python but the coding was more advance. My partner and I spent one week creating code in order 
to manipulate an image. These manipulations include adding a blue border around the frame of the image and rounding 
off the edges. Line 5 of the coding creates the border around the image while lines 39-46 rounds the edges. Line 56 
saves the newly modified images and gives it the name that the user input when the code was ran. I learned about 
using masks and adding layers onto them to create a new, fresh picture. I learned how to get specific spots of a 
picture and modify them to change the look and feel of it. This taught me how to get images into coding and how 
to set the directory to ensure success of the code.</h3></center>
