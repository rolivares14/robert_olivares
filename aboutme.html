<center><h1 style="color:white;">This is my About Me Page!</h1></center>
<center><p><strong>My name is Robert Olivares but you can call me anytime. I am a senior at Don Antonio Lugo. 
I am 17 years old and I love to play tennis in my free time. I was born in Los Angeles on October 14, 2000. 
I have 1 older brother, 1 older sister, and 1 younger sister. I have 2 dogs, one is a German Shepard and the other is a terrior. 
I want to major in mechanical engineering or in construction managemenrt in college. I will be studying mechanical engineering at 
Cal State Fullerton in fall of 2018,however, my plan is to transfer to UC Irvine or UC Santa Barbara after 2 years. If I had to 
pick only 1 meal to eat for the rest of my life it would be a chicken tator munchie meal from Jack-in-the-box and horchata.
My dream is to become an Imagineer to help construct rides and hopefully one day design them.</strong></p></center>
