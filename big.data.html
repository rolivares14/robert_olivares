<h3><strong><center>My partner and I looked into data about the total funds granted to non-government organizations. We looked 
at 10 service groups and documented how much many each service group was granted. The graph and the chart are a visual
reprensentation of the funds granted. I learned that there is data for everything and taught me how to collect it all.</strong></h3></center>

<pre>
<h3><strong><center>The simulation that my partner and I modified was an AIDS simulation. My partner and I altered the rate 
at which people fall in love and how long those relationships last. We were curious on what types of circumstances 
were needed in order to get the entire populationso we made even more changes. We increased the frequentcy of 
copulation and decreased the average condom use. I learned that small changes in coding can have a huge effect on the outcome.</center></strong></h3>
