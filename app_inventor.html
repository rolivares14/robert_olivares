<h1>Making a List Has Never Been Easier!</h1>
<pre>
<h2><strong>I seem to always forget what I need whenever I go to the store. What better way to solve this problem than by making 
an app that makes a list for you. Since a lot of people make lists for when they go shopping why not add a 
calculator as well.</strong></h2>

<h1 style="color:white;">Purpose of the App</h1>
<h2><strong>The purpose of our app is to give people the ability to make a list at will. Our app can be used to list whatever
the user desires. For example, you can make a grocery list or a list of school supplies. You can also use it to keep track 
of homework assignments. Key features of the app include the alphabetize feature which rearranges your list in alphabetical 
order when clicked. Another key feature is the suggestion button that when clicked a random object from the list pops up. 
You can be creative and give the suggestion button different purposes. The final key feature is the calculator. 
The calculator is a bonus feature and allows the user to add and subtract whole numbers. I learned the basics of coding
a mobile app. This language was similar to Scratch since they were both block coding based; however, App Inventor felt
like an introduction to Python in the sense that you had to be more precise in what block goes where. This taught me
about data bases and how storing information works.</strong></h2>
