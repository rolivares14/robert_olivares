<pre>
<h2><center><p> I recreated the game of Hangman on Repl.it. The following images are screen captures of the coding. </p></center></h2>

<center><h1 style="color:white;">Purpose of the Game</h1></center>
<center><h3><p>The purpose of the game is for the player to guess a word by entering letters into the program. With each incorrect guess, the man on the noose 
gains another limb until he has all 6 body parts and the player loses the game. One key feature of the game is the capability of selecting 
the difficult before guessing a word. Other key features include the drawings of the gallow and the man and as well as being able to 
choose whether or not to play again. This gave me a greater understanding of Python and allowed me to experiment with loops. It also showed
me that there is a lot of repetition in coding. It gave me a space to practice defining functions and thus made my future experience with 
Python less stressful and gave me a basis to go off of.</p></h3></center>
